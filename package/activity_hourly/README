activity_hourly.py counts the activity per hour from a list of json message objects. 

The scripts require the following imports: sys, json and numpy

The format of the input and output objects with examples can be found in: input and output object examples.docx

The script can be tested using activity_hourly_test.py. All tests are automated. A report of the test results is saved as ./tests/test_output.txt. Information about each individual test can be found in test_documentation.doc. 
The test script uses the ./tests/data/test_discord_messages.json file as input and saves ./tests/data/test_discord_daily_activity.json as output. The results can be compared to ./tests/data/test_discord_daily_activity_precomputed.json and ./tests/test_output_precomputed.txt

For hourly activity per day
The total number of messages per day = lone_messages + thr_messages + replier
The number of mentions per day = mentioner + rep_mentioner
The number of replies per day = replier
The number of emojis per day = reacter
The number of interactions per day = replier + mentioner + reacter (mentions of the author of a message that is replied to are not counted as extra interactions besides the reply)

For activity per account per day
Sent messages = lone_messages + thr_messages + replier
Outgoing interactions = replied + reacted + mentioner
Incoming interactions = replier + reacter + mentioned
Total interactions = outgoing interactions + incoming interactions

The analysis can be refined with the following optional parameters:
- Acc_names: if included, the counts for each account listed are stored as separate rows in the output. To get the original result, the output can be summed over the rows. To get the counts per day for the listed accounts, the output can be summed over the columns. Each object contains a variable acc_names which contains the account names at each index of the output. All counts for account names not listed are grouped together in the remainder row. If no account names are listed, all counts are grouped together in the remainder row.
- Mess_substring: if included, only the messages containing at least one substring in this list are considered. If not included, all messages are considered.
- Emoji_types: if included, only emojis in this list are considered. If not included, all emojis are considered.

Function documentation:
Input:
json_file - [JSON]: list of JSON objects with message data
out_file_name - str: path and filename where output is stored
acc_names - [str]: account names for which activity should be counted separately (default = [])
mess_substring - [str]: only messages containing at least one substring in this list are considered. all messages are considered if set to None (default = None)
emoji_types - [str]: only emojis in this list are considered. All emojis are considered if set to None (default = None)
		
Output:
warning_counts - [int]: list of counts for the different possible warnings that could be raised by the script:

1st entry: number of messages sent by author not listed in acc_names
2nd entry: number of times that a duplicate DayActivity object is encounterd. if this happens, the first object in the list is used.
3rd entry: number of times a message author mentions themselves in the message. these mentions are not counted
4th entry: number of times a message author emoji reacts to their own message. these reactions are not counted
5th entry: number of times an emoji sender is not in acc_names
6th entry: number of times a mentioned account is not in acc_names
7th entry: number of times an account that is replied to is not in acc_names	
		
Notes:
The results are saved as a list of JSON objects based on out_file_name


Example of using the function:

Normal use
warning_counts = activity_hourly(json_file, out_file_name, acc_names)

Specific substrings and all emojis (no need to implement this yet but could be feature in future)
warning_counts = activity_hourly(json_file, out_file_name, acc_names, ["thank", "grateful"], None)

Specific emojis and all substrings (no need to implement this yet but could be feature in future)
warning_counts = activity_hourly(json_file, out_file_name, acc_names, None, ["ü§ô", "üëç"])

Specific substrings and emojis (no need to implement this yet but could be feature in future)
warning_counts = activity_hourly(json_file, out_file_name, acc_names, ["thank", "grateful"], ["ü§ô", "üëç"])
