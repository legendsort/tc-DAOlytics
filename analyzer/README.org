#+title: RnDAO analyzer

This package compiles the scripts into an object, which can run continuously.
The package scrapes data from the database, processes is and pushes the result
into the database.

*Why python package?*
In future this will make it easier to integrate into services runable on the server.

* Running the program

** Installing the python package
Inside of the analyzer directory:

To install:
#+begin_src bash
make install
#+end_src

To load (development):
#+begin_src bash
make load
#+end_src

To unload:
#+begin_src bash
make unload
#+end_src

To reinstall when developing:
#+begin_src bash
make reload
#+end_src

** TODO Creating the analyzer object:
#+begin_src python
from rndaoanalyzer import RnDaoAnalyzer
a = Analyzer()
a.set_database_info(db_info)
a.run_once()
#+end_src


** TODO Setting the run frequency
How often should the analyzer be ran.

#+begin_src python
a.set_analyzer_frequency()
a.run_forever()
#+end_src

/This can also be done with a crontab./
