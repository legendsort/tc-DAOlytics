We have a need for a coordinator servant to assist the focused members of RnDAO. Internal Communications, Documentation and Scheduling need to keep up with the positive growth and new energy coming to RnDAO.

- creating an elected **RnDAO AdminAssist/Facilitator role for Comms/Docs/Scheduling** that sits within RnDAO as a liaison between Unit Leaders.

For clarity, this does not exclude others from speaking, it just simplify the process of responding to requests like the one we just had:

The master Miro board is great for transparency but it has become unworkable (multiple people, eg thegadget.eth#3374 Ashish G#1920 myself) struggle to use it as it's too heavy.

This proposal suggest moving to a more scalable structure where we keep the Miro board with columns for each Unit but instead of putting the content directly there, the ""master board"" links to Unit-specific boards. Essentially making the current board into a sort of index of Unit boards.

Nowadays, our roles (lead, contributor and supporter) are uniquely assigned to each person... So, for example, if someone is the lead, and contributors are tagged, this person don't get a notification. Same logic goes for contributors and supporters. 
Instead of having this scenario, I propose roles to be cumulative, meaning, lead automatically gets contributor and supporter, and contributors automatically gets supporter. So, no more tagging 3 roles if you want to talk to everyone for example.

We're quickly growing the number of Units in RnDAO, and right now there isn't a shared system or even a shared naming convention across Units. This is likely to add complexity and reduce our ability to share learnings.

As such, this proposal aims to create said shared language (a shared ontology and taxonomy) with a few basic rules to define the building blocks from which we construct RnDAO's organisational structure.

Limitations:
- this proposal doesn't include yet a Canvas for DAO Work units, but such work is planned.

TLDR of what's included:
- RnDAO is divided in two key areas: Projects and DAO Work (same as it already is)
- Units are defined as the core operating unit for teams (making the current practice official)
- Roles are defined within Units in two categories: Membership Roles (define level of membership to the unit) and Functional Roles (define additional rights and responsibilities as needed).
- The process for adding/eliminating roles and appointing people to roles is defined (our current decision making process)
- 3 Membership Roles for DAO Work Units are defined: Supporters, Contributors, and Janitors.
And an extra Membership Role for Project Units: Project Coach
- Two required Functional Roles are also defined: Radiator (responsible for sharing info about the unit with the broader RnDAO community) and, for Projects, Compensation Manager (responsible for ensuring proper accounting of contributions to the Unit)

*I know... this is not a security best practice... but I can't think of another solution right off the bat at the moment and I appreciate if could suggest something better.*

The problem is that RnDAO will always have accounts that rely on a single user logging in with an email/password pair. And whenever multiple people need to login into each service, they need to share those credentials and login by themselves with those credentials. We are talking about things like the RnDAO Twitter account, the newly created Gmail (Google) account, the newly created Zoom Pro account, and there will probably be more of those in the future and some others that we are already using but I'm not even remembering now.

So we need a way to store these credentials and distribute them to people, and keep track of who has them.

I propose that we create a private spreadsheet shared with only the multisig signers of RnDAO to store all of the credentials, and also other relevant data about using that service (for example, sometimes Twitter asks to confirm that the RnDAO's account phone number is danielo#2815 phone number because he was the one that created the account, same thing for the date of birth for example, so whoever else that logs into the RnDAO Twitter account needs to know Daniel's phone number or date of birth... yeah... it is what it is...) and also the list of people that each credential was shared with, so that we keep track of who knows which password.

Then, whenever someone that is not a multisig signer wants/needs to access a particular account, they just need to go to the #credentials channel and ask for a particular password. then, one of the multisig signers will go to the file, and copy/paste them the credentials so that they can use the account, and the multisig signer needs to add the name of the person that now knows the password for that service, into the spreadsheet.

This would mean that the decision to give a password to a requester would be done by one of the multisig signers that will be in the #credentials channel.

Also, the current state of affairs is that, me and Daniel are the only ones that know the Twitter password (I think, I'm actually not 100% sure) and I'm the only one that knows the RnDAO Gmail and Zoom account passwords because I just created both of them yesterday.

So, by agreeing with this proposal you agree to:
- Consent to having Paulo create a private spreadsheet and populate it with all current RnDAO credentials
- Follow this process of requesting a credential if you aren't a multisig signer, and to follow this process of giving and updating the spreadsheet if you are a multisig signer.
- Creating a new #credentials channel in the DAO Work category section of this discord.

In an effort to be more transparent about finances to the whole community, I propose that we create a #multisig channel in the DAO Work category of this discord server to accomplish several goals:

1 - bring awareness to everybody here (that has access to the DAO Work discord category) that RnDAO has a multisig, with funds in it, which is controlled by these particular signers (at the moment, Drea#4787, danielo#2815, RayKanani#0819 and me), and with these transactions flows.
2 - a place for the multisig signers to coordinate on creating transactions and approving them on time
3 - manage the up keeping of the Notion page that lists all multisig transactions (the databases in this notion page https://www.notion.so/Funds-Management-Process-8d79548a9c9240df891b5adf1f32f7b8 )
4 - anything else any of your thinks is a good idea for this

Just for awareness and context, here are our current multisig addresses

Meet with Wallet (MWW) provides an easy way to share your (or your DAO's) calendar and schedule meetings without any hassle or back-and-forth communication. All possible by simply connecting your crypto wallet. No registration needed, no more emails (only if you want to) - Information about your meetings is encrypted and kept private (only you have access), and only meeting time slots are public for an improved user experience. You know Calendly right? Same thing here, but for #web3!

More info https://meetwithwallet.xyz

MWW appreciates support through:

- Co-marketing and evangelizing the use of MWW
- We appreciate members of RnDAO using MWW and providing us with feedback
- Spotting and communicating to us user needs/pain points related to meeting scheduling/event organization/DAO coordination
- RnDAO members becoming contributors to the project

MWW will support RnDAO through:

- Co-marketing on all MWW channels (including members’ personal accounts)
- Interacting with RnDAO ecosystem (keeping up with what is happening in other projects) and connecting to opportunities when spotted
- Actively providing feedback on the incubation program and RnDAO structure

We've been using my company's Google Apps account to be able to record the public events and it is always a hassle to set it up and give permissions to everybody (that is outside of my company) to be able to record the events and the overall recording quality is not that good. By using Zoom, instead of Google Meet, we could potential have better quality recordings of the talks and user research interviews, and we could also integrate with 3rd party transcribing services that would give us the captions for the public event videos to be uploaded into youtube and transcripts for the user research interviews to be analysed later.

I envision that we can use a Pro Zoom account, which is $149.90 per year (minus a 30% discount for the first year that we can use) and a free https://listener.app or  https://otter.ai or https://tldv.io account, that would allow us to annotate calls live or afterwards, and would provide us with the text transcripts as well.

We would setup this account with an email and password that a few of us would have access to and would be able to share it between all the efforts in RnDAO that would need something like this. 

So, by agreeing with this proposal you agree to:
- Consent to having Paulo setup these accounts and integrations with an RnDAO email and password to be shared among the ones that need to use this
- Creating a rndao@gmail.com (or something similar that would still be available) email account so that we can have a generic email for RnDAO and to be able to use this email as the login email for these services
- Buying the Zoom PRO account with the RnDAO email
- Pay back 104.93 DAI to Paulo for the annual payment of this Zoom Pro account (as per the attached screenshot where you can see a charge of $104.93 after the 30% discount code)
- Using this zoom account and transcribing service in future public events
– Using this zoom account and transcribing service in future user research interviews

Hey there!
So, we’ve been using a myriad of tools to manage our “calendaring” needs, in a mostly ad-hoc and as needed way, and that has created a few issues that we’ve been noticing in the last few weeks.

With this proposal I aim to simplify our “calendaring” process and setup a workflow of tools to help us get the most out of the tools we use and reduce human error by automating the boring parts.

I’ve been thinking about this for a while and testing different tools. I’m 95% certain that the tool stack that I’m proposing will work on RnDAO and is feasible for our current setup.

I started by evaluating all the different tools we’ve been using, and did a table to figure out what each of them if great at (🌟), what each of them supports (✅) and doesn’t support (❌).

You can see that table in the attached image and in the Miro here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOUBXbkQ=/?moveToWidget=3458764527369925235&cot=14

With this I’ve realized that we can have a setup where we can have the best of all the tools if we adopt Sesh fully (meaning buying and using sesh premium) and integrate it with Discord native Events through ChronicleBot ( https://chroniclebot.com ) and then with our own personal calendars through the Sesh /link command.

So I’ve came up with this process for creating events in RnDAO that you can see here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOUBXbkQ=/?moveToWidget=3458764527371801960&cot=14

This proposal is to:
- Consent to having Paulo setup this process with and within RnDAO by committing to use it exclusively in the next 2 weeks and provide feedback about it.
- Buying Sesh Premium for the RnDAO Discord Server
- Pay back 62.73 DAI to Paulo for the anual payment of Sesh Premium (as per the attached screenshot)
- Delete all references in our Notion, Discord, and other places to the current Google Shared calendar link and replace it with a Sesh calendar feed URL
- Stop updating the current Google Shared calendar and eventually delete it
- Install Chronicle Bot in RnDAO Discord Server

Currently, the only onboarding we have in Discord is geared to contributors (e.g. the only way to signal that someone has joined an onboarding call is to give them the role ""Onboarded **Contributor**""

As per our discussion on last friday's workshop on members lifecycle and team roles, this proposal suggests creating an alternative path by:
1) renaming the New Contributor role to Joining Member and removing the permission to join projects (this will be left for Onboarded Contributors)
2) creating the RnDAO Friends role for members who go through an onboarding call and are not looking to become projects/dao work contributors. this new role will give them access to the discover category so they can continue to engage in our learning channel and other discussions
3) removing everyone who hasn't been active in Coordinape not has posted in a project team in the last 2 weeks from the Onboarded Contributor role, making a public announcement about this, and giving those who had their role removed the possibility to regain it by requesting it to Daniel if they wish to contribute to a project (so no need to join an Onboarding Call unless otherwise desired).

Separating biz dev makes a clear incentive but also means having a separate biz dev contribution accounting to manage (more admin overhead). And what we're seeing with noturhandle#0510 working on Community Analytics grant proposals is that he needs a deep understanding of the project and close collaboration with project members. So bringing biz dev into the circles of projects makes the most sense to me.

This proposal hence puts forth a 20% allocation to RnDAO's DAO work and 80% to project execution (including biz dev/sales work), as our default agreement (new projects can make a proposal to depart from this default)

I feel that Discord is not the right tool for Proposals (in the spirit of our ReOrg goal of ""right tool for the right task"").  With our proposal volume rising, I'm hoping it's Safe to Try to suggest better tools or processes.

I believe that this consists of:
- Creating a Notion page (either in Tools we use or Decision Making) to compare approaches
- Finding one or a few people who are willing to drive this
- defining goals (selection criteria)
- Soliciting options
- Deciding when one of the options is good enough
- Proposing that option in this channel for a formal vote.

I want to run Coordinape services for RnDAO, based on prior experience with Coordinape at Gitcoin.

In particular, I'd like to establish a cadence conducive to high level of participation. Coordinape does not work well, unless a predominant majority of circle members send GIVE during each epoch. Coordinape developers agree with the points in my paper, and we've been discussing best ways to mitigate. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ERaolYJa6l1D7Fwhvj2MQxF0TTycKAbPkcikFzxT0Qo

**Expected outcomes:** 
- A learning rhythm is established across the RnDAO community which allows members to easily learn from each other and quickly contribute to learnings on a regular cadence.

- We can leverage this learning muscle within RnDAO to inform product development of Level1 and pilot with other DAOs interested in consistently documenting and sharing community learnings.

**Research strategy:** Run a design thinking workshop with RnDAO members to ideate around the prompt 
How might we humanely prompt humxns to share learnings after an event

**Success metrics:** Learnings shared per week (0 --> 5)
This would be a new success metric that is currently not tracked

**Kick-off and learning review: **I'm hoping to use the incubator work stream to establish this. I would need support from work stream leads for this.

**Experiments:** I expect us to come out of the workshop with a list of experiments that we can try in order to get to our target success metric.

DAOs rely on their communities, so it is essential to announce and notify meetings. At the moment, RnDAO uses LettuceMeet, Google Calendar, and Discord Events for public and community meetings/events. The use of external software makes keeping the community informed difficult.

Sech is a free calendar integrated with Discord that can be easily installed on servers. Features include creating events, handling time zones, RSVP, linking to Google Calendar, creating polls, etc. (https://sesh.fyi/).

Funds are very likely to come soon from the approved SCRF grant and the first client based project (sub-daos research hired by Sobol). And these sources are likely to continue being our main income for some time.

To increase the chance that contributors can remain active in RnDAO, this proposal suggest the following approach to rewards:
- 20% of every grant/sale is given to the RnDAO treasury to fund RnDAO projects as decided by the members (this is meant to fund brand and organisational development and projects with future potential like the Incubation workstream)
- 10% of every grant/sale goes to the person/team who made the sale/proposal
- the person/team who made the sale/proposal decides on the team that executes (as they put their reputation on the line in addition to RnDAO's)
- the execution team receives the remaining 70% (or can chose to invest the funds in RnDAO, conversion rate between $ and Give points tbd)

Infrastructure wise, the funds are for now managed with a multisig for which we'd elect 5 members (3/5 signing)

We distribute Coordinape points for the work that's not remunerated, so it's possible to engage with RnDAO as a freelancer (doing sales and/or paid project-execution-work), as a labour-investor (investing time/labour to advance RnDAO beyond the projects).

A quick analysis of wokstream membership <https://sobol.io/d/rndao/structure?view=circles> shows that most people are participating in many workstreams. This is natural when the team is really small but might reduce our effectiveness and ability to deliver value as each workstream becomes more active and attention is spread thin.
Equally, each workstream is right now a single channel but the topics of conversation are multiplying and the number of proposals is growing. Also,
proposals were meant to tag the respective workstream (eg @undefined ) but this is not happening.

A combination of specialisation and trust can give us better focus and better outcomes.

So this proposals puts forward:
- Replace the Workstreams category with a category for each Workstream where the current channel is included and we can also add other channels as needed (e.g. a dedicated channel for Level1 under the Incubation Workstream)
-Divide the proposals channel into a proposal channel per category to be visible to all Onboarded Contributors but where only those who joined that workstream can vote (any Onboarded Contributor can join any workstream at any point)

We are spinning up our <#954317661850976276>, and we started with <@!833074850804793415>'s Level1. One of the things we decided was that for both parts (Level1 and RnDAO), the most useful thing right now would be to implement a learning journey of Level 1 for our RnDAO contributor onboarding. 
Also, since we are looking at it, we should think about the whole contributor onboarding journey on RnDAO, from how people discover us to when people are productively and recurrently contributing to RnDAO.

The first step would be to organize a workshop to work on our contributor onboarding journey and see how we could change it and implement Level1 on it.

I have not been able to follow the progress of last week and as I was trying to go over everything that was done on the Miro Board. I'm afraid things are only going to get more convoluted as we progress.

I wanted to do a bit of cleaning up and re-structuring everything by dates which would help me personally and new members to understand all the work that has been done so far.

Miro is a bit laggy already and with the amount of information that we have it will only get worse.  Right now its messy in my opinion.

My proposal is to re-organize everything linearly (left to right) and/or start removing things and making 1 page documents by date which we can store elsewhere (Notion?) for easy access.

I would love to do this alone or with someone ideally to do it faster.

yeah... so... hear me out... 🙂

From the beginning of this thing, our name was always something we didn't think much about. It started with R&D for DAOs, and then at a talk <@!795295822534148096> did, someone suggested RnDAO as a representative name for this project. We picked it up, debated a little bit if we should spend time thinking about a name for this, and ended up sticking with RnDAO. Then, we were supposed to present RnDAO at ETH Denver, and I designed some temporary logo for RnDAO, which is the one on this discord server and also the RnDAO transitioning to Research n' DAO animation that is our first tweet (https://twitter.com/RnDAO__/status/1498363206795988995?s=20&t=GpXD2zobN2CZ9Ht81n7iig). 
But... RnDAO is not very ""brandable"", it's not very recognizable, and... it just sounds weird.

On the other side, today marks the 1-month anniversary of our mission statement, ""empower humane collaboration"". These 3 words aim to communicate our mission here, and I think they do it well. It looks like an easy and simple statement to get to. Still, it took us a span of 4 weeks and 3 two hour-long sessions with around 10 different people to collaboratively and humanely come up with the ""empower humane collaboration"" mission statement for RnDAO. You can see all of that process in this Miro frame that <@!833074850804793415> beautifully facilitated (https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOUBXbkQ=/?moveToWidget=3458764518429644185&cot=14)
To me, this mission statement seems to be the most solid thing we have done here in RnDAO to date.

=================================================================
👉  **Continue reading the story on the thread and then get back here to vote in this message**
=================================================================


So, what is this long-ass proposal that I'm asking you to vote on?

**Do you think we should change our name from ""RnDAO"" to ""Humane DAO""?**

**Pros**:
Humane DAO is a more recognizable name, a more brandable one, and we actually already control the clean Twitter handle, the ENS name, the .org and .xyz domain name, etc...

**Cons**:
It is a name change... it is a lot of work, and it will confuse the people that already follow us. (although it is very much preferable to do this kind of change sooner, rather than later)
Also, it is a big responsibility to shoulder the ""Humane"" word as our name. We should not take that lightly.

**Next Steps**, if approved:
1. Design a brand around this name. I have a few ideas already and sketched them out on that night.
2. Change the ""RnDAO"" name to ""Humane DAO"" everywhere
3. Great Success! 🙂

- Students apply to the projects they want to work on
- RnDAO selects the student 
- The internship should start in early June for 3 months
- It can be paid or not, this is negotiable

Pros:
- Get support on some research project
- Get RnDAO associated with a University giving it credibility in the academic space

Cons:
- Provide support to the student during the internship to create good working conditions

Next steps if approved:
- Define a subject that will be useful to us and fit the guidelines

Learning is particularly important for RnDAO as it feeds the value proposition to incubate a venture here (access to high talent density and know-how, amongst  other things)

But Web3 is a firehose of content, and we can easily feel overwhelmed with all the info to consume. But what if we could collaborate our way out of it?

This proposal suggests transforming the <#920707473369878589> into a # learning-summaries channel. This new format would mean:

1) a signal (via upvoting this proposal) that creating summaries of every piece of content shared is valuable (a couple bullet points of key learnings or at least a phrase or two explaining what it's about or why to consume it or not)
2) a process to add the summaries to a wiki/knowledge base (the initial process would be a link to a notion page and instructions on the onboarding journey: update to onboarding doc and also update to the message in <#921468460062605334> )
3) a mechanism to reward summarising. The initial mechanism proposed is to use an emoji (🧑‍🎓 ) for us to react to summaries in the channel (provided a link to the summary in notion too is also added) and and at some point in the future, adding a sourcecred bot to calculate and distributing RnDAO tokens for brain reactions received  in that channel.

**About Level1**
Level1 is a learning and development platform designed for DAOs to help their members become and remain active. The project won the DAO Tooling category of the DAO Global Hackathon at the end of last year.

The project is currently open-source with more info at the links below.
https://github.com/level-1-dao/level-1-dao
https://level1.vercel.app/

Currently Level1 is maintained by myself and has a few technical contributors. The project is currently onboarding researchers and learning journey designers.

Level1 is working towards a pilot with Aragon, currently in final testing stages, and is in talks with OlympusDAO, GiveEth, and Odyssey who are all interesting in using Level1 for community onboarding.

**What is Level1 looking for?**
- An active test bed for decentralized learning and development use cases. This will allow us to listen, learn and iterate faster.
- Vibez. It's lonely being a small team. It's also a heavy lift to implement mission, decision protocols, values, discord setup, knowledge management... All things that I'm inspired by from RnDAO.
- Access to talent. RnDAO currently has 170+ members all from different backgrounds and skillsets. It would be great to be able to tap into this membership in order to co-create the project
- Research. The magic of RnDAO. There are things Level1 would like to do but to do it, it requires a deep understanding of the options and the pros/cons. One of these things is recognizing guides and learners in the platform through potentially a token issuance that allows them to influence the direction of the platform. Another is allowing DAOs that use the platform to have a stake in the platform itself.
- partnerships/grants/paid pilots. RnDAO is building a name in the DAO space. Being able to leverage this to secure grants, partnerships and paid pilots would be a great accelerator.",,,,,"paulofonseca#1987,🔖"

@Onboarded Contributors 

We recently had a proposal approved to start running events, with me and <@!641449673818898472> working on the project we now have some ideas around format and 4 speakers being scheduled.
Equally, Paulo has created an MVP brand and the community architect role has been approved through a previous proposal (appointment pending) and I'm running onboarding calls 1-2 a week.

All this work is mostly operational, and so fits weirdly under the Org Design workstream.

The proposal is then to bring the above (events, community funnel, discord channels architecture, branding) under a single wosktream and hopefully appoint 1-2 leads and a couple of contributors to help advance this work.

Until now, I've unofficially enacted this role. However, there is ambiguity about how decisions should be made and unclear responsibilities (eg Paulo raised s tension about lack of documentation).

This proposal seeks to formally create said role with the following accountabilities:
- define the general architecture of the community (including membership levels)
- implement said architecture on the comms platforms (specially, Discord)
- regularly seek feedback to refine said architecture
- keep up to date documentation about the architecture and rationality for it

The delegate will be elected afterwards, should this proposal be consented to.

Should the proposal face significant opposition, this delegate role will be kept on the Org Design Workstream backlog and work on it left pending until the workstream can get there or until another proposal is made.

We have a conversation pending about reward systems, but it will take us some time before we can get there. This proposal is meant to serve us to capture some data about contributions to date (and there after until and if we decide on a new system). The risk of not doing this is increased risk of conflict or failing to acknowledge contributions.

This proposal also sets the creation of a delegate role (not a discord role, just a person(s) with authority delegated to them) to whom RnDAO will entrust the management and calibration of the coordinape circle (eg. Defining epochs length, adding contributors, defining rewards per contributor). The delegate will be elected afterwards, should this proposal be consented to.

Should we think about having a “Core Team” role here in discord? We would need to define the criteria to give and take that role, how to automate that attribution mechanism and what access and privileges that role would give to people. And probably some other things I’m not seeing right now. 

So, do we want to think about that?
