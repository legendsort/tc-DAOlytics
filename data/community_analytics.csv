So, what has been happening is that every time you create a new event, by using the sesh /create command in <#969982517027422228> Sesh will assume, by default, that the event's location will be in the Meeting room voice channel, because that's the default voice channel for all new sesh events in RnDAO. Sesh then creates the native discord event which will be shown in the native discord sidebar and send people to the specified location at the time of the event, where they can click the big green [ Join ] button at the top.

In the case of projects, calls should happen in the Meeting room (projects) voice channel. Which means that every time you create a new sesh event, you need to override the default location of the Meeting room voice channel. To do that, you can still create the event as usual, by using the /create sesh command, but then you need to edit that newly created event, go to the web browser and change its location to be the Meeting room (projects) voice channel. 

This is also true if you decide to change the location of the call to any other platform, like Google Meet, like it happened just now. You will also need to edit the sesh event and specify that the call event will happen, not in one of our discord voice channels, but in an external service, and add the call link in there.

This is important to avoid what just happened, where for this ""Proposed measures for Aragon"" event, some people were in the Meeting room voice channel, because that one was the default location on the sesh and discord event, some people were on the Meeting room (projects) channel, because that is the usual place for project calls, and some people were on the google meet link, outside of discord.

I think katerinabc#6667 has been the one creating events for community analytics, so Katerina, if you need any help with this, reach out to me and we'll figure it out.",katerinabc#6667,,,,"Fabs#8423,katerinabc#6667,üíØ&WaKa#6616,danielo#2815,üôè"

I thought I'd share some interesting findings based on a trust survey I and a friend have been prototyping with DAO teams. More info on the survey and reason behind it here https://discord.com/channels/915914985140531240/939512862492205056/986813312295645184

Team members are completing the survey and indicating high trust in a lot of different areas except for one. The area that currently indicates low trust is team members giving each other feedback.

Both of these questions come back with rarely or sometimes as the most popular response.
- Team members call out one another‚Äôs deficiencies or unproductive behaviors.
- Team members challenge one another about their plans and approaches.

Maybe something to think about when assessing community health. Artificial harmony might be something many communities struggle with without knowing it's a problem

- Makes us think in more detail on the inherent assumptions we are using
- Try and avoid bad surprises as we hit the market
- Hels with cross team collab. e.g. product team can identify the data points that need to checked in market research

I have populate a few fields to give an idea of what I am suggesting. If this approach makes sense, we can do a 1 hour workshop early next week, where we can discuss and populate the table

Basically, working in web3 vs web2 is:
- going from a binary state of engagement (employment) to a multi-level ranking system
- going from **DISCRETE** to **CONTINUOUS** values.
- bonding community engagement with the organisation‚Äôs productivity (no engagement, no work done)

And the **Engagement Cloud Model** proposes to measure the Engagement Cloud Score as the result of the addition of all the in and out flows between each engagement layer of a community.

I have kinda thought of a group as externally and somewhat subjectively defined, based on some observable or designated attribute, and not through a shared property of self-identification of the designated members.

There can be a very close but not defining situational correlation. For example, a bus full of people heading downtown mid-morning will have a high percentage of office workers. Someone interested in this attribute will readily classify them as such.

1. **Project Management**: How to create the conditions that will lead this project to succeed
2. **Outcome Management**: What do we need to deliver to create an impactful outcome

LINK TO NOTION: https://www.notion.so/Proposed-project-structure-4054698ac28f44638eb2f90fc2dc1da9

In terms of the next steps I believe we could collaborate on 2 things:
1. Defining the challenges and deliverables for each step
2. Expressing our interest in contributing to specific challenges / steps

This should give us a starting point where:
- we know where we're going
- we know who wants to do what
Which will ease things later to fill in the gaps, and help us break the project down into actionable tasks.

Please have a look and let me know what you think. If there is consensus on this approach I would suggest also restructuring the Notion project page to reflect this.

Thanks to everyone for joining the call and apologizes for going over time. Below a summary of the call. If something isn't captured, please let me know. See notion for more information. 

Decision: We are solving a problem that is happening inside a DAO

Next meeting: Katerina will send out a lettucemeet to find another spot. Our goal is to have a recurrent meeting. 

Tasks: User research:
Daniel started it and needs help. Have a look at notion  (DAO Community Analytics/ User Research) to see what has been done. 
Way you can contribute:
1. Ask Daniel to shadow meetings to get to know how he does it and then lead some calls
2. Reach out to your network to find other people to interview

Task: Academic research
Katerina will look at scientific literature on (online) communities and compile a list of metrics that have been used to measure community health
Ways you can contribute:
- Add metrics
- Review metrics in Notion (DAO Community Analytics/ metrics)

Technical documentation
Sepeher is reviewing technical document about how to build a bot.
Ways you can contribute:
Review the information, add links to example bots (with available code) that would help us building the MVP
