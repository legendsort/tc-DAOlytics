assess_activity_hourly_system.py counts the activity per hour from a list of json message objects. 

The script can be tested using assess_activity_hourly_system_test.py. All tests are automated. Information about each individual test can be found in test_documentation.doc. 
The test script uses the ./tests/data/test_discord_messages.json file as input and saves ./tests/data/test_discord_daily_activity.json as output. 

In addition, a report of the tests is saved as ./tests/test_output.txt. 

The results can be compared to ./tests/data/test_discord_daily_activity_precomputed.json and ./tests/test_output_precomputed.txt

The analysis can be refined with the following optional parameters:
- Acc_names: if included, the counts for each account listed are stored as separate rows in the output. To get the original result, the output can be summed over the rows. To get the counts per day for the listed accounts, the output can be summed over the columns. Each object contains a variable acc_names which contains the account names at each index of the output. All counts for account names not listed are grouped together in the remainder row. If no account names are listed, all counts are grouped together in the remainder row.
- Mess_substring: if included, only the messages containing at least one substring in this list are considered. If not included, all messages are considered.
- Emoji_types: if included, only emojis in this list are considered. If not included, all emojis are considered.

Output:
warning_counts - [int]: list of counts for the different possible warnings that could be raised by the script:
